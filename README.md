# getting_and_cleaning_data_course_project
This is the course project for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course

The R script called run_analysis.R does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

A separate code book describing the variables used for this project is contained in this repo.
